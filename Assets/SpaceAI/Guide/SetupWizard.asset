  firstMsg: In this quick guide, you will get information on how to set up ship models.
    For example, let's take a small fighter, first you need to place it on the stage.
    Before clicking the button below, you need to create a "StreamingAssets" folder
    and move the "Configurations" folder there.
  secondMsg: Great! Please note that the model must be turned by the front part in
    the direction of the Z vector. This is necessary so that the ship moves forward.
    The next step is to configure the main component (ship controller)
  trdMsg: 'If you moved the Configuration folder to StreamingAssets, you will see
    several buttons. These are the configurations of different ships, more detailed
    information on the settings file can be found in the Components documentation,
    now click "Load: XWing"'
  frtMsg: Great! The file is loaded, it remains to add a collider for the ship, without
    it it will not be able to bypass obstacles and receive damage
  fiveMsg: Everything is ready, you can enjoy the flight!
